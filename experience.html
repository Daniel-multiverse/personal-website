          I got my first experience with coding when I was 16/17 years old, when
          I first went to sixth form. We were taught VB.net and it was really
          fun, but, it was shorlived as programming teacher left 4 months in and
          wasn't replaced during my time there.

        <p class="title">The comeback</p>

          I pretty much gave up on Computer Sicence after as I didn't get much
          exposure to it as a whole after my teacher left. Fast forward some
          years, I've been working in property for a decent amount of time and I
          looking for a change in industry. I found some free courses on Udemy
          and it reignited my interest, I decided to try another course by a man
          called
          <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/">Colt Steele</a> and I
          was hooked!
