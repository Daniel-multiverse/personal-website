      <p class="intro"> I prefer classic cars to the modern ones, and the above cars pictured in the forground are two
        of my favourites. The one on the left is called the Nissan R34 GTR (specifcally the V-spec 2 edition) and the
        one on the right is the Toyota MK4 Supra. They are often reffered to the "Kings of the JDM (Japanese Domestic
        Market.) era" which occured from the 80s to the 2000s.

      <p>I love going to the gym as I get a good buzz working out. Prior to moving to east London, I was learning Muay
        Thai which I aim to get back into before summer as I foudn a gym near-by, getting kicked or kneed sounds scary
        but I enjoy pushign myself mentally. </p>

        alt="" srcset="">

      <p>I've been a big fan of Arsenal for most of my life and finally the future is looking bright, the past years
        have been tough on my mnetal health.</p>
